Overview of the analysis: 

The purpose of the Module 9 challenge is to use a SQLite database that contains weather conditions in Oahu, Hawaii. The premise behind this challenge to convince an investor to invest into a surf board shop that sells ice cream. The shop, Surf n' Shake, will theoretically sell surf boards and ice cream through the entire year. However, the investor is cautious becuase he has previously invested in businesses with the same concept only to fail due to weather conditions. We have already provided the precipitation data we found from our SQLite database. He now wants to see the temperature fluctuation in Oahu in the months of Juen and December. We will need to provide a statisical weather analysis in order to convince our investor that opening Surf N' Shake on Oahu is will be a successful and profitable investment.

Results: 
* There is no major fluctuation between the temperature in June as compared to December. The mean temerature in June is ~75°, and 71° in December.
* There is little fluctuation between June and December's maximum temperatures where June's is 85° and December's is 83°.
* The minimum temperature shows the greatest fluctuation with June's temperature being 64° whereas December's minimum temperature is 56°.

Summary: 

Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
Besides the temperature data provided from our SQLite database, I would also be interested in which months tend to have the most severe weather (which is not included with our database, but could be found and added). I would also want to be aware of the temperature at various weather stations throughout the island. In case there became an opportunity to expand Surf N' Shake, already having the data in hand would be a great start towards that venture.
